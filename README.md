# startermod_class
A basic class mod to get you going!

Instructions for use: Download the mod. Unzip to your stonehearth mods directory, as a peer to stonehearth.smod and radiant.smod. Make sure the folder is named startermod_class, not startermod_class-master. 

Inside the startermod_class folder, you should see a manifest.json file, and 2 folders, one called entities and one called recipes. 

The mod adds two new objects to the world, and a new recipe to the carpenter, so that you can see at least one of the objects in the world. 

Before digging into the mod files, if this is your first time modding, you may want to checkout startermod_basic
